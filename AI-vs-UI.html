                <p> People say AI is the new UI do you agree

                    Lets see what is UI and AI first,
                    In simple words,
                     UI ( User interface ) is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur.
                    AI (Artificial intelligence) is intelligence demonstrated by machines , unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans.
                </p>    
                    <img class="hero-img " src="/images/ai.jpg" alt="image"/>
                <p>
                    AI is definitely very powerful and there is a lot to explore in that field.
                    For future of current students there is a big question is AI is good for there profession?
                    And the answer is both yes and no 
                    <br>
                    Yes if the student is ready to Pursue till Phd and this also in good universities in foreign lands.
                    No if student don’t want to do this much in AI field because UI is proving itself a great carrier by the advancement in UI because of Javascript
                    <br>
                    But AI really do have better future than UI in technology
                    Answer is no there is no technology ever to survive more than 10-15 years as there are changes and better technologies to come . 
                    UI is having good time currently and AI do have too but For current time UI shows better future jobs in india until AI is valued in India BY companies.
